<h2 class="mainpage">Background</h2>

	<p>
	Hi, my name is Ryan Farrar and I am currently a student at the University of Iowa. I am from a town called Wheaton, which is a suburb 30 minutes west of Chicago. I have one brother who is a junior at The University of Iowa
	and a sister who is a junior at Wheaton Warrenville South High School.
	In high school I played basketball and football, and miss competing in each of the sports everyday. I won a state championship
	in football my senior year and had one of the best experiences I oculd have ever asked for. I also love the game of basketball, it is 
	easily my favorite sport. I am also a die hard Chicago Bulls fan and love Michael Jordan. 
	</p>


	<p>
	Some of my hobbies include playing sports, working out, listening to music, and just having a good time.
	I am currently a senior at The University of Iowa and majoring in Business Analytics Information Systems.
	Here at The University of Iowa I am a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity and also a member of the 
	Business Technology Association. After college I hope to work for a professional services firm as a consultant in
	their IT risk advisory & assurance department, and eventually become a partner.
