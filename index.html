	<h1> About Ryan</h1>
	<p>
	I am from a town called Wheaton, which is a suburb 30 minutes west of Chicago. I have one brother who is a junior at The University of Iowa
	and a sister who is a junior at Wheaton Warrenville South High School.
	In high school I played basketball and football and actually won a state championship my senior year. 
	Basketball is easily my favorite sport and have played it my whole life.
	I am a die hard Chicago Bulls fan and love Michael Jordan. 
	</p>
	Some of my hobbies include playing sports, working out, listening to music, and just having a good time.
	I am currently a senior at The University of Iowa and majoring in Business Analytics Information Systems.
	Here at The University of Iowa I am a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity and also a member of the 
	Business Technology Association.
	After college I hope to work for a large consulting firm in their IT Advisory sector.
