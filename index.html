	I am from a town called Wheaton, which is a suburb 30 minutes west of Chicago. I have one brother who is a junior at The University of Iowa
	and a sister who is a junior at Wheaton Warrenville South High School.
	In high school I played basketball and football and actually won a state championship my senior year. Basketball is easily my favorite sport.
	I am a die hard Chicago Bulls fan and love Michael Jordan.
